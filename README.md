**Author:** Reagan M. Mogire

## Overview

This repository contains the data and R scripts associated with the manuscript titled:

> **"Early Pandemic Associations of Latitude, Sunshine Duration, and Vitamin D Status with COVID-19 Incidence and Fatalities: A Global Analysis of 187 Countries"**

The study investigates the associations between geographical latitude, sunshine duration, and vitamin D status with COVID-19 incidence, mortality rate, and case fatality rate across 187 countries during the early stages of the pandemic.
